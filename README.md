# Releases

Releases of the Community Data License Agreements.

* [CDLA-Permissive-1.0](CDLA-Permissive-1.0.md): The CDLA-Permissive agreement is similar to permissive open source licenses in that the publisher of data allows anyone to use, modify and do what they want with the data with no obligations to share any of their changes or modifications.
* [CDLA-Sharing-1.0](CDLA-Sharing-1.0.md): The CDLA-Sharing license was designed to embody the principles of copyleft in a data license. In general, if someone shares their data, the CDLA-Sharing agreement puts terms in place to ensure that downstream recipients can use and modify that data, and are also required to share their changes to the data.
* [O-UDA-1.0](O-UDA-1.0.md): The Open Use of Data Agreement (O-UDA) is intended to make it easier for individuals and organizations that want to share data to do so, with minimal requirements for users and no restrictions on use.
* [C-UDA-1.0](C-UDA-1.0.md): The Computational Use of Data Agreement (C-UDA) is intended to define a specific data use scenario involving the use of data sets for AI training purposes, in a manner consistent with expectations of commercial users.

# History

The CDLA agreements were developed to address the needs of sharing data, particularly in the context of AI and ML use cases. The Permissive-1.0 and Sharing-1.0 agreements were developed and released in October, 2017. The O-UDA-1.0 and C-UDA-1.0 agreements were originally published by Microsoft in November, 2019.

# Future

The CDLA agreements are undergoing discussions for revisions to merge concepts around permissive, sharing, and computational use only use cases.
